# Decision Tree Classification using Scikit-Learn

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build, train, visualize, and analyze a
Decision Tree classification model using Scikit-Learn on a real-world dataset.

##  Dataset
- Heart Disease Dataset
- Binary classification:
  - `0` → No Heart Disease
  - `1` → Heart Disease

## Tech Stack
Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-Learn | Matplotlib | Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
The notebook covers the following steps:
1. Importing required libraries  
2. Loading and understanding the dataset  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
4. Data preprocessing  
5. Train-test split  
6. Decision Tree model building  
7. Model evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix  
8. Decision Tree visualization  
9. Analysis and conclusion  

##  What Project Covers
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Decision Tree model training
- Model evaluation
